# Chapter 4: Qdrant Vector Store

Qdrant is a high-performance vector database that stores and indexes vector embeddings (numerical representations of text, images, or code) for fast similarity search. It is a foundational component of modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## Why Use a Vector Store?

For our RAG chatbot, the vector store holds the embeddings of our book's content. When a user asks a question, their question is converted into a vector, and Qdrant quickly finds the most relevant text chunks from our book to provide to the AI for generating an answer.

## Qdrant Client Setup

You must install the Qdrant client library in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install qdrant-client

Basic Collection and Vector Insertion
The following code demonstrates connecting to a local Qdrant instance, creating a collection (a container for vectors), and inserting a simple vector point:

from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

# 1. Initialize the client (connect to Qdrant server)
client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

COLLECTION_NAME = "book_chunks"

# 2. Create a collection with a specific vector dimension (e.g., 1536 for OpenAI embeddings)
client.recreate_collection(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=1536, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
)

# 3. Insert a point (vector)
client.upsert(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    points=[
        models.PointStruct(
            id=1,  # Unique ID for the chunk
            vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...], # 1536 dimensions
            payload={"source": "Chapter 1", "text": "Spec-Driven Development is best..."}
        )
    ]
)
The payload section ({"source": ...}) is crucial for storing the original text and metadata, which is retrieved when a query matches.
