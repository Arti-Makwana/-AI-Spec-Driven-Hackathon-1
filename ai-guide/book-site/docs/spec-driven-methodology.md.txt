# Chapter 1: The Spec-Driven Methodology (SDD)

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is a disciplined, engineering-first approach that places a clear, written specification at the center of the development workflow. This approach prevents guesswork and ensures AI agents, and human team members, work from a single, verifiable contract—the specification.

## The Core Philosophy

Instead of writing code first and documentation later, the Spec-Driven approach treats the specification as the *source of truth*. Code must serve the spec, not the other way around.

This is a shift from ad-hoc prompting (or "vibe coding") to a structured methodology. By forcing requirements to be clearly defined upfront, SDD creates a verifiable contract that guides all subsequent work.

## The Four Phases of Spec-Kit

The Spec-Kit methodology breaks down development into four clear, sequential phases with built-in review checkpoints:

### 1. Specify

* **Goal:** Define the **what** and the **why** of the project.
* **Process:** A high-level description is provided, and the AI agent generates a detailed specification focusing on user journeys, goals, and acceptance criteria.
* **Artifact:** The resulting **`spec.md`** file, which captures the intended outcome.

### 2. Plan

* **Goal:** Translate the specification into a high-level technical **how**.
* **Process:** The developer provides technical direction (stack, architecture, constraints), and the AI generates a detailed plan that respects these choices.
* **Artifacts:** Documents like **`plan.md`** and potentially others (e.g., `api-spec.json`) codify the technical decisions.

### 3. Tasks

* **Goal:** Break the technical plan into small, executable, and reviewable chunks of work.
* **Process:** The AI analyzes the `plan.md` and generates a granular, enumerated task list.
* **Artifact:** The **`tasks.md`** file, which acts as a project manager's checklist to structure the implementation.

### 4. Implement

* **Goal:** Generate or write the code for each task and verify it against the spec.
* **Process:** The developer instructs the AI to complete small units of work. The output is reviewed against the original `spec.md` and `plan.md` to ensure accuracy.
* **Outcome:** Verifiable, consistent code that adheres to the established architectural constraints.
