# Chapter 3: Setting up the FastAPI Backend

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) Python web framework used for building robust REST APIs. It is designed to be highly efficient and automatically generates interactive documentation.

## Initial Setup

You will need to install FastAPI and Uvicorn (the ASGI server) in your virtual environment. The recommended installation includes standard dependencies for a full environment.

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]" 

Creating a Simple GET Endpoint
A minimal FastAPI application, typically saved as main.py, imports the FastAPI class and uses decorators to define routes. This example defines a simple health check at the root URL.
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create the FastAPI instance
app = FastAPI()

# Define a simple GET path operation at the root URL ("/")
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    """
    Handles GET requests to the root path.
    """
    return {"message": "Welcome to the AI-Driven Spec-Kit Guide API"}

from fastapi import FastAPI

Running the Server with Uvicorn
To start the API server locally, you run Uvicorn, specifying the file (main) and the application instance (app), usually using the --reload flag for development.
uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will typically start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can access the automatic, interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at /docs (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
